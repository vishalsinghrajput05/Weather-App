# Prodigy-Intern-T5-Weather-App
This Weather App was developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides real-time weather updates based on the user's location. The app features a clean and responsive UI, displaying current temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and a multi-day forecast. Weather data is fetched using a weather API.
